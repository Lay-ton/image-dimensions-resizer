# image-dimensions-resizer

I made this for a website I'm working on. I had some film pictures converted to digital and wanted resize them for proper displaying on the website.

It has a default dpi of 300 that it tries to keep the images at, something you have to be aware of when you're altering the sizes of images.
The code will generate an image for each size specified, if none are specified there are some default sizes.
